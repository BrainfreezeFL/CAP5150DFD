Please use the files in final code for the final project, the other files are from the checkin point. The models are too big to attach here, so I will link them using google drive here:

I ran the models using a docker container with the tensorflow image you can get from their site. running the retrieve_model_colab.py script with the models in the same directory should generate the results. You will need to modify the locations of the test data files though.
